# Even Coding Exercise Prep

Thank you for interviewing with Even!

As part of our interview process, we'd like to see your ability to both read & modify existing code that you didn’t write.

To achieve that, we'll share a small but representative/real-world codebase with you, and ask you to fix some bugs.

## Process

The way we'll conduct this interview is:

 - Get you set up with the codebase and ask you to share your screen.
 - Point you to some bugs and ask you to fix them.
 - Give you some time at the end to ask us questions about Even.

As you’re coding, we’ll be silent observers for the most part. We really want to see how you do on your own, but we’re happy to be sounding boards & [rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) if that’s helpful.

We also really want you to feel as comfortable and “at home” as possible. So even though this is an interview, you don’t need to “narrate your thoughts” to us as is normally expected in other interviews. And you’re free & encouraged to Google, Stack Overflow, etc. as we all do in the real world when we code.


## Setup / Pre-Work
We offer this interview in multiple languages. Reply to our email to let us know which language you prefer, and make sure you have an up-to-date version installed:

 - Python: 3.8+ (with pip3) (note: our Python code uses [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html))
 - JavaScript: Node 12+ (with npm)
 - Java: 8+
 - Go: 1.13+

You'll also want to have your preferred editor/IDE set up, for your own benefit!

You should be comfortable reading and writing real-world code in the language you pick. If none of the languages above meet that bill for you, let us know as feedback!

Make sure your laptop is set up to git clone and git push to GitHub. E.g. see this documentation on [connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

Finally, make sure you can join a [Zoom video call](https://zoom.us/) and share your screen. If you don’t already have it, be sure to download & install Zoom and set up your audio & video.

### Development Environment

Please make sure your development environment is set up, by running:

```
./devsetup.sh
```


## Bugs

Each bug will be demonstrated by a failing test, and fixing the bug correctly should make the test pass. The bugs will be in order of increasing difficulty.

Bugs can be tricky and may take some time to figure out. That's okay! We'd rather see fewer correct fixes (with solid understanding) than multiple incorrect fixes.

One tip: while finding the bugs can be challenging, the bugs themselves are not convoluted. They’ll hopefully all feel clear & obvious once you find them, as real-world bugs often do. =)


## Final Notes

We know interviews can be daunting & stressful. We've been there!

We've worked hard to make this interview as real-world and normal as we can. E.g. as noted above, you’re free & encouraged to Google & Stack Overflow just like normal. Hopefully you find this interview to be close to your experience in reality. =)

Good luck, and we look forward to working with you!
